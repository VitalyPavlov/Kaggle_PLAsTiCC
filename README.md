# Kaggle PLAsTiCC Astronomical Classification

The Photometric LSST Astronomical Time-Series Classification Challenge (PLAsTiCC) asked Kagglers to help prepare to classify the data from this new survey. Competitors classified astronomical sources that vary with time into different classes, scaling from a small training set to a very large test set of the type the LSST will discover.
